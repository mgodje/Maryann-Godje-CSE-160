Inspired from Three.js Journey by Bruno Simon

https://threejs-journey.com/#presentation Lesson 16: Haunted House 

Changes I made:
    - Grass texture changed to be bigger blades of grass
    - changed lighting to be red, orange, and gold in color to give a spooky feel
        - removed shadows from these lights
    - fewer tomb stones/gravestones
    - changed color of ambientLight to be redder
    - moonlight is more intense
        - removed intensity control from moonlight to keep it at 0.5
    - added "Haunted House" text to the scene
        - changed camera's position to see text and house better
        - added a lights to the text
    - changed roof color to black
    - added lights to two bushes
    - added three ghosts to the scene
